This simple application lets you display a list of your notes (including a title and a text area for each), let's you write/post new notes to add to the list, and delete notes once they've been taken care of and are no longer needed 
## Installation
No need to install, simply visit the live heroku URL: https://note-taker-shawncrook-3244bd11af4a.herokuapp.com/notes.html 
## Usage
To use, go the the URL. From there the website is live and you can access. After navigating off of the main page you can type on the right hand side the title of your new note and and text to accompany it.
